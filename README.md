Works in progress at Roots and Branches

To the extent possible, source texts, data, and scripts used for my Roots and Branches works in progress will be shared here. 

Source materials are are either in the public domain or are shared under a claim to fair use. 

Notes and comments are separated as branches of the underlying source materials.

Data are shared as is. I will try to indicate which data are the products of human input and which are machine-assisted. In either case I assume an error rate somewhere in the 1-5% range.
